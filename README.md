# ToDoApp Project

The first project I worked on while learning JavaScript was the ToDoList. Through this project, I learned many new things and improved my web development skills.

## About the Project

This project is a simple To-Do List application where users can track their tasks. Tasks can be added, edited, completed, and deleted. Additionally, you can filter the list to manage completed and pending tasks.

## What I Learned During the Project

- **Class Structure**: I learned the importance of classes and how to use them.
- **Dynamic Web Page**: I learned how to make the page dynamic.
- **Console Usage**: I learned the benefit of providing information in the console during site usage.
- **ID and Class Usage**: I learned how to assign structures with specific IDs and classes to variables and work with them.
- **Filtering**: I learned how to filter tasks to interact only with selected items.
